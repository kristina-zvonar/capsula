Duality of declarative and imperative programming styles is a reality when developing software nowadays. While imperative approach brings more flexibility, control, and easier debugging, declarative styles are more expressive, easier to use, and reduce number of bugs in the program. Capsula provides for both styles, letting the programmer decide when to use which of the two and of course when to combine them. 

For example, this duality becomes obvious when building user interfaces: is it better to use templates (being a declarative approach) or object-oriented style (imperative)? 

Capsula library tries to resolve this by providing means to build user interfaces by using either one of the styles or both. It allows engineers to choose between templates and object-orientation according to their personal preferences or assessment of the tasks to be performed. Although syntactically different, artifacts developed using the two different styles in Capsula are semantically alike and could easily be combined and used together.
